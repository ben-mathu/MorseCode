# MorseCode
Receives plaintext and converts them to morsecode.

The Morse code is really fullstops and dashes.

Spaces between each code is as described <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code">here</a>.

Defined each alphabetical letter as its own variable name and number as variable name num#.

The morseCodeCreator(text) is a function that accepts a string then loops through the string converting letters and numbers to Morse code.

Just an update
